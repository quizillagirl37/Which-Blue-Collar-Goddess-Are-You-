        <img src="images/kate-gosselin.jpg" alt="Kate Gosselin" class="celebrity-image">
        
        <p>You're quiet and reserved, interested in security and peaceful living. You have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends you a serious air and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and methodical in your approach, you can generally succeed at any task you undertake—like raising eight children on national television while maintaining that haircut.</p>

        <p>Like Kate—born Kate Kreider 1975 in Pennsylvania, worked as a labor and delivery nurse, married Jon Gosselin 1999, gave birth to twins 2000, underwent fertility treatment and had sextuplets 2004, started reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8 in 2007—you're very loyal, faithful, and dependable. You place great importance on honesty and integrity. You're a good citizen who can be depended on to do the right thing for your family. While you take things very seriously, you also have an offbeat sense of humor and can be fun at gatherings—as long as those gatherings are filmed and you're paid.</p>

        <p>You believe in laws and traditions and expect the same from others. You're not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. You believe things should be done according to procedures and plans. If you haven't developed your Intuitive side sufficiently, you become overly obsessed with structure and insist on doing everything by the book—like the color-coded schedules for eight children, the meal plans, the bedtime routines, the way you scream at Jon for not folding the towels correctly on camera.</p>

        <p>You're extremely dependable on following through with things you've promised. For this reason, you get more and more work piled on you. Because you have such a strong sense of duty, you have difficulty saying no when given more work than you can reasonably handle—which is why you agreed to having cameras film your children for years, why you signed them up for every spinoff, why you wrote multiple books, why you went on Dancing with the Stars, why your family became America's most-watched trainwreck.</p>

        <p>You work for long periods and put tremendous amounts of energy into any task you see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, you resist putting energy into things that don't make sense to you or for which you can't see a practical application. The practical application was: eight kids cost money, reality TV pays money, therefore reality TV makes sense. You prefer to work alone but work well in teams when the situation demands it—though "team" does not include Jon, who you berate constantly for his incompetence.</p>

        <p>You have tremendous respect for facts. You hold a tremendous store of facts within yourself, which you've gathered through your Sensing preference. You may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea different from your own perspective—like the theory that filming your children's entire childhoods might be harmful, or the idea that screaming at your husband on national television might damage your marriage. Once you support a cause or idea, you stop at no lengths to ensure you're doing your duty of giving support where support is needed. Your cause is providing for eight children. Your method is surveillance capitalism.</p>

        <p>You're not naturally in tune with your own feelings and the feelings of others. You have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately as they're presented. Being a perfectionist yourself, you have a tendency to take other people's efforts for granted, like you take your own efforts for granted. You need to remember to pat people on the back once in a while—but you're too busy counting the ways they've failed to meet your standards.</p>

        <p>You're likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others. However, your strong sense of duty and ability to see what needs to be done in any situation usually allows you to overcome your natural reservations. You're quite supporting and caring with the people you love—you just show it by controlling every aspect of their lives and screaming when they deviate from the schedule.</p>

        <p>You're extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, you put forth great amounts of effort at making your home and family run smoothly. You're a responsible parent, taking your parenting role seriously. You're usually a good and generous provider to your family. You care deeply about those close to you, although you're not comfortable expressing your love. You express affection through actions rather than words—like getting divorced from Jon in 2009, getting custody of the kids, continuing the show as Kate Plus 8, writing books about your struggles, appearing on Celebrity Apprentice, maintaining that asymmetrical blonde-streaked haircut years past its expiration date.</p>

        <p>You have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and implement it through to completion. You're a very hard worker who doesn't allow obstacles to get in the way of performing your duties. You don't usually give yourself enough credit for your achievements, seeing your accomplishments simply as the natural fulfillment of your obligations. You have a great sense of space and function and artistic appreciation—your home is tastefully furnished and immaculately maintained, even with eight children destroying it daily.</p>

        <p>Under stress, you fall into catastrophe mode, where you see nothing but all the possibilities of what could go wrong. You berate yourself for things you should have done differently, or duties you failed to perform. You lose your ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and depress yourself with your visions of doom—which is why you scream at Jon about gum wrappers, why you sob to the cameras about being alone, why you keep renewing contracts even when your kids beg you to stop filming.</p>

        <p>Like Kate Gosselin—nurse turned reality star, mother of eight, divorced, estranged from multiple children as adults, still appearing on reality TV, still maintaining some version of that haircut, still insisting everything she did was for the kids—you have a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical, reasonable, and effective with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living, you have what it takes to be highly effective at achieving your chosen goals. You just chose the goal of monetizing your children's childhoods and then wondered why they won't talk to you anymore.</p>
